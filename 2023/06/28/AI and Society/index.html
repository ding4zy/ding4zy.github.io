The Cold War-era rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union (characterized by nuclear deterrence) has transformed into a competition between China and the United States in the field of AI, leading to an AI arms race. AI has become a new scenario for geopolitical and technological planning. Therefore, we propose the future of The Stack, Web3: Metaverse + AIGC, Religion, Nation &amp; State, and Empire. We also explore how to establish a closed loop from ethics to technology between a new infrastructure and the Eastern world.<br>￼<br>This question arises from continuous discussions across political, economic, and social levels, resulting in a scenario analysis: Is the East more imaginative? Can AI be developed into a more morally conscious entity within Confucian ethical and cultural ideals? Can humans and AI coexist and thrive together?</p>
<h2 id="1-Stack"><a href="#1-Stack" class="headerlink" title="1. Stack"></a>1. Stack</h2><p>The Stack model does not place “technology” within “society,” but rather views technology as the central component of society itself. Its focus is not merely on providing services for governance or opposing governance through computation, but on considering computation as governance itself. The first chapter introduces various planetary-scale computations as interconnected and forming a larger, tightly linked whole, such as smart grids, cloud computing, mobile or interurban software, universal addressing systems, ubiquitous computing, and robotic technologies. They haphazardly constitute a gigantic structure called “The Stack,” which is not just a planetary-scale computing system, but a new architecture for dividing sovereign spaces in the world. Specifically, this model is shaped by the multi-layered structure of software protocol stacks, with network technologies operating between modules and interdependent vertical structures. This model allegorizes how the logic of the Stack becomes a universal rule of entry into the system and describes the geometry of political geography and the overall outline of the technologies occupying these spatial domains. The Stack model is global but not static. On the contrary, it is inherently modular, so these gigantic structures are also platforms, even interfaces, designed to redesign and replace the existing stacks with the stacks we desire (or do not desire).</p>
<h2 id="2-Planetary-Computation"><a href="#2-Planetary-Computation" class="headerlink" title="2. Planetary Computation"></a>2. Planetary Computation</h2><p>the Berggruen Institute is launching a new research program area, in partnership with the One Project foundation: Antikythera, a project to explore the speculative philosophy of computation, incubated under the direction of philosopher of technology Benjamin Bratton. The purpose of Antikythera is to use the emergence of planetary-scale computation as an opportunity to rethink the fundamental categories that have long been used to make sense of the world: economics, politics, society, intelligence and even the very idea of the human as distinct from both machines and nature. Questioning these concepts has of course long been at the heart of the Berggruen Institute’s research agenda, from the Future of Capitalism and the Future of Democracy, to Planetary Governance, the Transformations of the Human, and Future Humans. The Antikythera program described here exists on its own, but also in dialogue with each of these other areas.<br>For Bratton and the Antikythera team, planetary-scale computation demands that we reconsider: geopolitics, which will increasingly be organized around parallel and often competing “hemispherical stacks” of computational infrastructure; the process of production, distribution and consumption, which will now take the form of “synthetic catallaxy;” the nature of computational cognition and sense-making, which is no longer attempting merely to artificially mimic human intelligence, but is instead producing radically new forms of “synthetic intelligence;” the collective capacity of such intelligences, which is not located only in individual sentient minds, but rather forms an organic and integrated whole we can better think of as an emergent form of “planetary sapience;” and finally, the use of modeling to make sense of the world, which is increasingly done through the computational “recursive simulation” of many possible futures.</p>
<h2 id="3-kama"><a href="#3-kama" class="headerlink" title="3. kama"></a>3. kama</h2><p>Kama, (Sanskrit: “Love,” “Desire,” “Pleasure”) in the mythology of India, the god of erotic love and pleasure. During the Vedic age (2nd millennium–7th century BCE), he personified cosmic desire, or the creative impulse, and was called the firstborn of the primeval Chaos that makes all creation possible.<br>In our logic, stack is a technological way of connecting societies, while kama links relationships between individuals.<br>![[attachments&#x2F;Pasted Graphic 1.jpg]]</p>
<p>关于stack是什么、行星计算是什么，从这个出发提出来西方堆栈以及通过技术来拯救人类的逻辑。kama是什么。</p>
<p>郑永年教授最近也写了篇文章，关于AI时代的中国开放战略。冷战时期的美苏争霸（核威慑平衡）变成了中美争霸（AI领域军备竞赛），AI成为地缘政治和技术的新情景规划，所以我们提出了the future of The Stack, Web3: Metaverse + AIGC, Religion, Nation &amp; State and Empire.以及如何实现一个新的基础设施和东方世界之间的从伦理到技术的闭环。</p>
<p>这就是来自政治、经济和社会各个层面，持续沟通后产生的问题，形成了一个情景分析：那么，东方是否更有想象力？将ai打造成儒家关于伦理和文化的理念中更有道德的人？人类是否能够和ai共同繁荣？</p>
